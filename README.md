#### CSS & Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio
This homework asignment was to create a mobile responsive portfilio using Bootstrap. I created the 3 HTml files along with a CSS file to add a few customizations. While my footer still needs work, the rest on my portfilio website should be working for mobile view.
