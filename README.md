#### CSS & Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio
  This homework assignment was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap and make it your own. I created the 3 HTML files, along with a CSS file to add a few customizations. While my footer still needs work, the rest on my portfolio website should be working for mobile view. 

## CSS
  I created my own CSS file to customize the Bootstrap I copied and pasted from the website. In the image below you can see I changed colors and added fonts to customize my website and make it more unique. I used google fonts rather than sticking with the fonts given through Bootstrap.

## Nav Bar

  In the image below you can see I have copied and pasted a navbar from Bootstrap. I edited it to fit the assignment by linking the other HTML files and adding the titles of them in the nav bar. So when you click on Portfolio it takes you to the portfolio page of the website. I purposely kept them below the top border and to 'float' above the main content of each web page, because that is how I decided I wanted my website to look.

## Semantic HTML

  When you copy from Bootstrap the tags are mostly 'div', making the readability rather difficult. So, as the assignment said I changed most of the 'div' to be semantic HTML. This is something I struggled with because there were so many 'div' at times I found myself a bit lost in my HTML. I used my google fu skills and found a very helpful list of semantic HTML elements along with their definitions. As you can see in the image below I had quite the time organizing my tags to be more fitting rather than the sea of 'div'. I learned the hard way that it's probably not the best idea to wait until the end to format the HTML to have clear semantic elements.
